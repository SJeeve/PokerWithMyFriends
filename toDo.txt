-Need to plan how I'll implement the actual poker game
  -First distribute cards to each player (Done)
  -rate hand and then declare winner (Done)
  -Then implement ability to discard
  -Then add ability to bet (raise, fold, call)
  -Add base ai so npcs can make better decisions
    -Ok so for the ai I believe it would be best to use a reinforcement learning algorithim
    -Each ai will only have it's own hand as information, as well as how much the other ai are betting
    -Reward ai with the amount of chips it won 
    -Subtract amount of chips lost, unless they folded before hand in which case only 75% of chips lost will be subtracted from reward
  -During development make ai modular so values can be easily changed
  -Make .json to store data for each person

-Need to plan how I'll implement the actual poker game
  -First distribute cards to each player (Done)
  -rate hand and then declare winner (Done)
  -Then implement ability to discard
  -Then add ability to bet (raise, fold, call)
  -Add base ai so npcs can make better decisions
    -Thanks to Paul Hankin on stackoverflow
    -Ok so, to do this I can make a lookup table of every possible poker hand (create this file on first boot). Then enumerate over         all possible replacement cards, and average the possibility of winning from your hand. 
    -To store the data table, I could use a 5-dimensional list
    -Probably should use a data table though
  -During development make ai modular so values can be easily changed
  -Make .json to store data for each person

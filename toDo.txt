-Need to plan how I'll implement the actual poker game
  -First distribute cards to each player
  -rate hand and then declare winner
  -Then implement ability to discard
  -Then add ability to bet (raise, fold, call)
  -Add base ai so npcs can make better decisions
  -During development make ai modular so values can be easily changed
  -Make json to store data for each person
